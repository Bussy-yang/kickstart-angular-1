#   layer2.conf -- Configuration the Layer2 ESP application
#
#   Use this file if you want to host this application with a pre-existing appweb.conf. 
#   Include this file from the master appweb.conf by placing under conf/apps.
#   

<if ESP_MODULE>
    #
    #   Use the EspApp to define an application. This creates a URI location for "/layer2" and uses the ESP application
    #   located at /Users/mob/git/layer2. This is equivalent the location definition below.
    #   This defines a location, routes, and configures the espHandler to serve requests to this URI location.
    #
    EspApp /layer2 /Users/mob/git/layer2 restful mdb://layer2.mdb

    #
    #   Load the application when compiled flat into a single module.
    #   Use this if you wish to compile flat (esp compile flat)
    #
    # EspLoad layer2 cache/app

    #
    #   Alternatively uncomment below to use a Route block instead of the EspApp above. 
    #  This provides more control over exactly how the application is defined and configured. Don't use both!
    #
    # <Route /layer2>

        #   Descriptive name for the route
        #
        # RouteName layer2

        #
        #   Define the directories used for cache, controllers, layouts, static and views. 
        #   Use "mvc" to set all directory names to their Model-View-Controller defaults. This must be done before any
        #   route directives.
        #
        # EspDir mvc

        #
        #   Define the application database. Use "mdb" for a Memory database, "sqlite" for a SQLite database, 
        #   or "mysql" for MYSQL. 
        #
        EspDb mdb://layer2.mdb

        #
        #   Keep the compiled view source in the cache directory

        #
        #   Show recompilation and internal errors in the browser

        #   Reset the route table. This clears inherited ESP routes to start afresh.
        #
        # EspReset routes

        #
        #   Define a route for the home page
        #
        # EspRoute home GET,POST,PUT %^/$ ${STATIC_DIR}/index.esp

        #
        #   Define a route for static content
        #
        # EspRoute static GET %^/static/(.*) ${STATIC_DIR}/$1

        #
        #   Define a route for controller/actions
        #
        # EspRoute default GET,POST ^/{controller}(/{action}) ${controller}-${action} ${controller}.c

        #   Alternatively, instead of defining routes one-by-one, you can enable a set of "RESTful" routes.
        #   This can be used without args, or can be used as: "EspRestfulRoutes /URI-prefix controllerName".
